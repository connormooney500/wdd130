    <p>Hi my name is Connor, I am 24 years old and I am from West Jordan, Utah! I enjoy playing soccer,
        hanging out with friends, and playing videogames! I also have really enjoyed learning about and
        working with computers, so I am glad to be able to do this class! I currently work in custoemr
        service and am majoring in software engineering.
    </p>

        I served my mission in Quito, Ecuador and I really loved it! The culture, people, and language
        was all very awesome to be able to learn and experience! Ive been a member of the Church since
        I was born (which is pretty obvious being from Utah, lol) and am glad to be studying at BYUI!
